    "# Lasso, and elasticNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two more supervised learning algorithms that use shrinkage for regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso is an acronym for \"least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.\"  It uses L1 regularization: the penalty applied to the cost (loss) function minimized during training is an L1 norm:  a constant (alpha here) times the sum of the absolute values of the regression weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "elasticNet is a regularization method that combines the regularization penalties used in ridge regression (the L2 norm) and by the Lasso(L1 norm).\n",
    "\n",
    "An important difference between the Lasso and Ridge regression is that the latter can shrink coefficients, but it can never make them equal to zero short of `alpha` going to $\\infty$.  Lasso _can_ shrink coefficients to zero, an advantage when there are lots of regressors, and interpretation of their importance is of interest.  Lasso can be used for variable _selection_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we'll again use the inpatient satisfaction data.  We'll apply the Lasso.  We'll rescale the predictor variables, use cross validation, and search for a \"good\" shrinkage parameter value.  Then we'll experiment a little with elasticNet."
